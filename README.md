ðŸŸ¡ This is the simple todolist with the implementation of solidity and blockchain: </br>

âš¡ Objective of this dapp is to store the text in the blockchain </br>
âš¡ fetch the store data from blockchain </br>
âš¡ render it in the web </br>

ðŸ›‘ haven't deployed the smart contract on the test net thats why i haven't mentioned the demo url but you can use it  after deploying it in your local hardhat network.





# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
